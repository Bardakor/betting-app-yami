# Betting System Fix Complete âœ…

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Middleware Architecture Consistency âœ…
**Problem**: The main service middleware was inconsistent with other services.
**Solution**: 
- Added proper `authenticate` middleware to all protected routes in `auth.js`
- Ensured all services follow the same authentication pattern
- Fixed service-to-service communication endpoints

### 2. Bet Placement Fixed âœ…
**Problem**: Bets were stuck on "Placing..." due to:
- Incorrect betType format (backend expects `match_winner`, frontend was sending `Match Winner`)
- Selection case sensitivity (backend expects lowercase)

**Solution**: 
- Updated `BetSlip.tsx` to normalize bet types: `"Match Winner" â†’ "match_winner"`
- Normalized selections to lowercase: `"Arsenal" â†’ "arsenal"`
- Added better error logging for debugging

### 3. Balance Updates Fixed âœ…
**Problem**: Adding money to balance wasn't working due to missing endpoints.
**Solution**:
- Added `/auth/update-balance` endpoint for user balance updates
- Added `/auth/admin/update-user-balance` for admin operations
- Fixed wallet service integration with proper authentication

## Current System Status

### âœ… Working Features:
1. **Authentication**: Login/Register with JWT tokens
2. **Balance Management**: Deposit, withdraw, and balance updates
3. **Bet Placement**: Place single or multiple bets with proper validation
4. **Bet History**: View all bets with filtering and pagination
5. **Live Matches**: View and bet on live matches
6. **Admin Functions**: Add funds to any user account

### ðŸ”§ API Endpoints:

#### Main Service (Port 3001):
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /auth/profile` - Get user profile
- `POST /auth/update-balance` - Update own balance
- `POST /auth/admin/update-user-balance` - Admin update any user balance

#### Through API Gateway (Port 8000):
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login
- `GET /api/wallet/balance` - Get balance
- `POST /api/wallet/deposit` - Deposit funds
- `POST /api/bets/place` - Place a bet
- `GET /api/bets/my` - Get user's bets
- `GET /api/fixtures` - Get fixtures
- `GET /api/odds/:fixtureId` - Get odds for a match

## Testing the System

### 1. Login as Admin:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@admin.com", "password": "admin123"}'
```

### 2. Place a Bet:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/bets/place \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fixtureId": 123,
    "betType": "match_winner",
    "selection": "home",
    "stake": 50,
    "odds": 2.5
  }'
```

### 3. Add Funds (Admin):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/wallet/admin/add-funds \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "USER_ID",
    "amount": 1000,
    "description": "Bonus funds"
  }'
```

## Frontend Usage

1. **Login**: Go to http://localhost:3000/login

   - Navigate to Live Matches

   - Enter stake amount
   - Click "Place Bet"

3. **Add Funds**:

```

## Troubleshooting

If bet placement fails:
1. Check browser console for detailed errors
2. Ensure all services are running: `npm run dev`
3. Verify user has sufficient balance
4. Check that betType is one of: `match_winner`, `over_under`, `both_teams_score`

If balance doesn't update:
1. Refresh the page (balance updates on page load)
2. Check network tab for API responses
3. Ensure wallet service is running on port 3004

## Next Steps

The betting platform is now fully functional with:
- âœ… User authentication
- âœ… Balance management
- âœ… Bet placement
- âœ… Real-time odds
- âœ… Transaction history
- âœ… Admin controls

All critical issues have been resolved and the system is ready for use!
