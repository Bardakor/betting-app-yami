# Betting Platform Issues - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå **Adding Money to Balance Doesn't Work**
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Problem**: 
- Frontend was calling API Gateway (port 8000) which was not properly routing to wallet service
- Wallet service was missing environment configuration
- API Gateway proxy configuration was not working correctly

**Solution**:
- Added deposit endpoint directly to main service (`/auth/deposit`)
- Updated frontend to call main service directly for deposits
- Implemented proper authentication and balance updates

**Test Results**:
```bash
# Deposit $100 - SUCCESS
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/auth/deposit" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount":100,"paymentMethod":"credit_card"}'

# Response: {"success":true,"message":"Deposit successful","transaction":{"amount":100,"newBalance":100100,"timestamp":"2025-07-06T23:58:12.357Z"}}
```

### 2. ‚ùå **Placing Bets Gets Stuck on "Placing..." with No Response**
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Problem**:
- Frontend was calling API Gateway which was not properly routing to bet service
- Bet service was missing environment configuration
- Microservice communication was failing

**Solution**:
- Added bet placement endpoint directly to main service (`/auth/place-bet`)
- Updated frontend to call main service directly for bet placement
- Implemented proper bet validation, balance deduction, and user stats updates

**Test Results**:
```bash
# Place bet - SUCCESS
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/auth/place-bet" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fixtureId":868549,"betType":"match_winner","selection":"arsenal","stake":25,"odds":2.15}'

# Response: {"success":true,"message":"Bet placed successfully","bet":{"id":"bet_1751846298996_min123","fixtureId":868549,"betType":"match_winner","selection":"arsenal","stake":25,"odds":2.15,"potentialWin":53.75,"status":"active","placedAt":"2025-07-06T23:58:18.996Z"},"newBalance":100075}
```

- ‚úÖ Deposit $100: Balance becomes $100,100
- ‚úÖ Place bet $25: Balance becomes $100,075
- ‚úÖ Frontend automatically refreshes user balance after operations

### Bet Placement

- ‚úÖ Checks sufficient balance before placing bet
- ‚úÖ Deducts stake from user balance
- ‚úÖ Updates user statistics (totalBets, pendingBets)
- ‚úÖ Returns bet confirmation with bet ID and new balance

### User Experience

- ‚úÖ "Placing..." indicator resolves properly
- ‚úÖ Balance updates immediately after operations
- ‚úÖ Error handling for insufficient balance
- ‚úÖ Success/error toast notifications

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

1. **Fix API Gateway**: Resolve proxy routing issues for proper microservice architecture
2. **Add Transaction History**: Implement transaction logging for deposits and bets
3. **Add Withdrawal Functionality**: Complete the wallet service integration
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Add more detailed error messages and validation
5. **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket support for live balance updates
