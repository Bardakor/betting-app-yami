# MongoDB Connection Fix

## Issue

The betting platform was encountering MongoDB authentication errors when trying to add money to wallets and place bets. The errors were:

```
MongoServerError: Command insert requires authentication
```

## Root Cause

The MongoDB container was running with authentication enabled, but the application was not properly configured to authenticate with MongoDB.

## Solution

We implemented the following fixes:

1. **Updated database connection configuration**
   - Modified all service database connection files to use MongoDB without authentication for local development
   - Simplified connection logic to connect directly without trying multiple connection methods

2. **Created local MongoDB setup**
   - Created a script (`start-local-mongodb.sh`) to start MongoDB without authentication
   - Created a MongoDB initialization script (`setup-local-mongodb.js`) to create the necessary databases

3. **Improved model schemas**
   - Added proper MongoDB ID handling with virtual fields
   - Added proper indexes for better performance
   - Ensured consistent field naming between services

4. **Added test scripts**
   - Created a MongoDB connection test script
   - Created a wallet deposit test script
   - Created a bet placement test script
